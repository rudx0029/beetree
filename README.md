# ![beetree logo][logo] BeeTree

*BeeTree* is a behavior tree application framework written in `C++ 11` and targeted for small to medium embedded processors, e.g. *ARM Cortex M0* and *ARM Cortex M4*. The goal of the framework is to help make programming robotic behaviors more approachable for embedded processors while providing sophisticated behavior. This is accomplished by representing robotic strategies and behaviors as interchangeable, modular behavior trees, while maintaining a small, nimble footprint.
